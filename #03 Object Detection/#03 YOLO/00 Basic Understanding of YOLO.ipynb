    "YOLO : You only Look Once\n",
    "    - Its an algorithms, only look once at the image wich means it perform one forward propagation to the neural network to make\n",
    "      the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yolo is used for Object Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Yolo is Very fast but Less Accurate\n",
    "\n",
    "How YOLO Works?\n",
    "    - YOLO algorithm works using the following three techniques:\n",
    "        1. Residual blocks\n",
    "        2. Bounding box regression\n",
    "        3. Intersection Over Union (IOU)\n",
    "        \n",
    "Residual blocks:\n",
    "    - It take an image and split it into an SxS grid, within each of the grid we take m bounding boxes.\n",
    "      there are many grid cells of equal dimension. Every grid cell will detect objects that appear within them.\n",
    "    - Generally Yolo uses 19X19 grid.\n",
    "    - Every grid cell will have seperate output, it look like as below\n",
    "            \n",
    "            y = [1,bx,by,bh,bw,0,1,0]\n",
    "            \n",
    "            here 1 mean, there is a object in the grid cell, otherwise it will be 0. if it is 0 \n",
    "                 means there is no need of calculating bx,by,bh,bw\n",
    "                 \n",
    "                 last 3 values in the above 0,1,0 are reprsent the Object class. here 3 class we have considered\n",
    "                 \n",
    "Bounding box regression:\n",
    "    - A bounding box is an outline that highlights an object in an image.\n",
    "    - Every bounding box in the image consists of the following attributes:\n",
    "        - Width (bw)\n",
    "        - Height (bh)\n",
    "        - Class (for example, person, car, traffic light, etc.)- This is represented by the letter c.\n",
    "        - Bounding box center (bx,by)\n",
    "        - YOLO uses a single bounding box regression to predict the height, width, center, and class of objects.\n",
    "        - For each of the bounding box, the network outputs a class probability and offset values for the bounding box. \n",
    "        - The bounding boxes having the class probability above a threshold value is selected and used to locate the object \n",
    "          within the image.\n",
    "        - YOLO is orders of magnitude faster(45 frames per second) than other object detection algorithms.\n",
    "        \n",
    "Intersection over union (IOU)\n",
    "    - Intersection over union (IOU) is a phenomenon in object detection that describes how boxes overlap. \n",
    "    - YOLO uses IOU to provide an output box that surrounds the objects perfectly.\n",
    "    - Each grid cell is responsible for predicting the bounding boxes and their confidence scores. \n",
    "      The IOU is equal to 1 if the predicted bounding box is the same as the real box. \n",
    "      \n",
    "      Lets say: Actual bounding box in the image is Green color,now algorithm predicting BB is in green color\n",
    "             now how to know that weather algorithm gave us good outcome or bad outcome?\n",
    "             we can find that using Intersection over union\n",
    "            \n",
    "          IOU = Size of the Intersection / Size of union\n",
    "          \n",
    "          if IOU > 0.5, it means BB predicted by algorithm is correct\n",
    "          \n",
    "Limittaion of YOLO:\n",
    "    - The limitation of YOLO algorithm is that it struggles with small objects within the image\n",
    "    \n",
    "Non-max Supression:\n",
    "    - Non-max supression is algorith used to cleaning up when multple boxes are predicted for the same object.\n",
    "    \n",
    "How Non-max Supression works\n",
    "    - Discard all boxes with probability less or equal to 0.6\n",
    "    - pick the box with the largest probability output as a prediction\n",
    "    - Discard any reamining box with IOU greater than or equal to 0.5"
