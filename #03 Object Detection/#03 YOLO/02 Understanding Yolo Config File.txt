- Max_batches = 6000 
	- Total number of Iteration of Model Trainig.
	- Max_batches = (num_classes * 2000)
	- Minimum value is 6000 if the num_classes is 1 or 2 or 3. 
          If the num_classes is more than three then it would be of (num_classes * 2000)
- steps
	- Steps : (80%,90% of Max Batches)
	- Adjust the learning rate after 4800 and 4800 batches
	  steps = 4800,5400 (4800 is the 80% of the 6000(Max_batches) and 5400 is the 90% of the 6000 (Max_batches))
- Batch:
	- Number of images processed in one batch during one iteration

- Subdivision
	- Number of Mini batches In one batch

- scales=0.1,0.2
	- After 4800 (Steps), multiply the LR by 0.1, then after 5400(Steps) multiply again by 0.2

- angle: augment image by rotation up to this angle (in degree)

- policy=steps
	- Use the steps and scales parameters below to adjust the learning rate during training	


- filters: How many convolutional kernels there are in a layer
	- filters = (num_classes + 5) * 3

- activation: Activation function, relu, leaky relu, etc. See src/activations.h
